# BlackJack
This is a basic implementation of the popular card game Blackjack in Python. The game involves a player trying to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while playing against a dealer who follows fixed rules. It uses a standard deck of 52 cards, features simple hand value calculations, and includes error handling.
